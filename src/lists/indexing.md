# Special Indexing 

Lists are indexed by by surrounding an index with \\([\\) and \\(]\\) after a list.

| Contrary to a programmer's first instict, indices begin at one, not zero. |


## Indexing multiple elements

You can use a list to index multiple elements at once. 

\\[L_1=[1...10]\\\\L_2=[1,3...9]\\\\L_3=L_1[L_2]\\]
