# Useful functions for creating art

## Recreation projects

When recreating an image, there are a few simple functions which can make it easier.
These will be listed on this page.

### Linear functions

For a project like this, these are most easily written in point slope form, i.e. \\(y=y_1-m(x_1-x)\\)

### Quadratic functions

These are easily written in either vertex form or factored form.

| Form     | Equation                | Copyable                                  |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Vertex   | \\(y=a(x-h)^2+k\\)      | `y=m\left(x-h\right)^2+k`                 |
| Factored | \\(y=a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\\) | `y=a\left(x-r_1\right)\left(x-r_2\right)` |
| Standard | \\(y=ax^2+bx+c\\)       | `y=ax^2+bx+c`                             |

### Exponential functions
